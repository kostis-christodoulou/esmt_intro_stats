# Climate change and temperature anomalies

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and
`na`.

1.  The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in
    Row 2, so we need to skip one row.
2.  `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the
    spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see
    that missing data is coded as "\*\*\*". It is best to specify this
    here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric
    data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather`
in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to `Tools` \> `Global Options` \> `Pane Layout` and tick
the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and
the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide
format.

You have two objectives in this section:

1.  Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather`
    dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this
    assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

2.  Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use
    `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as
    `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as
    `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.

```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(1:13) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 2:13,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "delta"
  )
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for

1.  year,
2.  month, and
3.  delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called
`date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot
chronologically.


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

base_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Temperature Anomalies"
  )

base_plot

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels;
that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or
abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

```{r facet_wrap}

base_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month, ncol = 3)

```



It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the
`mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using `case_when()`.

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the
`Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to
`interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

comparison %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=delta, fill = interval)+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)+
  facet_wrap(~interval, ncol = 1)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
`group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(......) 

#plotting the data:


  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method

  
  #change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
                        


```

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their
website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php)
that

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast
> amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that
> much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge
> the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual
delta in the `interval` since 2011. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has
already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we
are only interested in what is happening between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```

# Global warming and political views

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"


In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
```

We will be constructing four 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas 'by hand'-- just remember to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response) %>% 
  filter(response != "Don't know / refuse to answer") %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = response,
    values_from = n
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(proportion = earth_is_warming / (earth_is_warming + not_warming)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(proportion))
```

Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? You may want to read on [The challenging politics of climate change](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-challenging-politics-of-climate-change/)
